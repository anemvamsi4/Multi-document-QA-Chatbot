# Q&A Chatbot with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Welcome to the Q&A Chatbot project! This repository contains the code and resources for building and deploying a Q&A chatbot that can answer questions based on a set of provided documents. The chatbot uses the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique with Llama2 model to generate context-aware responses.
